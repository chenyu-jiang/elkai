BLKH is a program for solving the Bottleneck Traveling Salesman Problem (BTSP)
and the Maximum Scattered traveling Salesman problem (MSTSP).

The code is distributed for research use. The author reserves all rights to the
code.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION: (Version 1.1 - February 2021)

The software is available in gzipped tar format:

    BLKH-1.1.tgz        (approximately 1 MB)

Download the software and execute the following UNIX commands:

    tar xvfz BLKH-1.1.tgz
    cd BLKH-1.1 
    make _O

Five executable files called BLKH, BLKH_EXP, MBLKH, MBLKH_EXP, and LKH will now
be available in the directory BLKH-1.1. LKH is an executable of LKH-2.0.9.

More efficient executables of BLKH and BLKH_EXP are obtained by executing the
UNIX command: 

    make _R

BLKH is used for solving a given BSTP instance once, whereas BLKH_EXP is used
for solving a BTSP instance using a specified number of independent runs,
default is 10. 

MBLKH and MBLKH_EXP are the corresponding executables for solving MSTSP
instances.

To ease the running of BLKH and BLKH_EXP, four scripts, runBLKH, runBLKH_ASYM, 
runBLKH_EXP, and runBLKH_ASYM_EXP, are provided. They create suitable parameter
files and execute BLKH or BLKH_EXP. Scripts with denotation ASYM are used for
asymmetric instances.

Similarly, to ease the running of MBLKH and MBLKH_EXP, four scripts, runMBLKH,
runMBLKH_ASYM, runMBLKH_EXP_ASYM, and runMBLKH_ASYM_EXP, are provided.

In order to ease solution of a specified subset of instances, the following
scripts are provided:
    
    runAMAT, runATSPLIB, runBALAS, runCOIN, runCRANE, runDISK, runHARD, 
    runJM, runMSTSP, runNATIONAL, runRAN, runRECT, runRTILT, runSHOP, 
    runSMAT, runSTILT, runSUPER, runTEST, runTMAT, runTSMAT, runTSPLIB,
    runUK66+US1097, runVERY_LARGE, runVLSI

It is recommended to run the script runTEST in order to
test the installation:

    ./runTEST

The runBLKH script may be used for solving other instances. Just change 
the value of PROBLEM_FILE in the script. 

The BLKH-1.0 directory contains the following subdirectories:

  TSP_INSTANCES:  Library of symmetric benchmark instances.
                  The files (418 MB) can be downloaded from 

      http://www.akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/BLKH/TSP_INSTANCES.tgz

  ATSP_INSTANCES: Library of asymmetric benchmark instances.
                  The files (478 MB) can be downloaded from 

      http://www.akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/BLKH/ATSP_INSTANCES.tgz

  SRC:             Source code of BLKH.

  LKH-2.0.7:       Source code of the current version of LKH.

  TMP:             Temporary files used during the solution process.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1:
----------------------

LKH-2.0.9 is used instead of LKH-2.0.7. This makes POPMUSIC candidate edge
generation and GPX2 recombination available.

VERSION 1.0:
-----------

Created April 2014.
